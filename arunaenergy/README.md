# AWS Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform

This repository contains Terraform scripts to set up a production-level infrastructure on AWS. It includes CI/CD pipelines, observability, and application monitoring, using services like Amazon ECS for container orchestration, AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD, and Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring.

## Project Structure

The Terraform configuration is divided into modules for better organization:

terraform/
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── modules/
├── networking/
│ ├── main.tf
├── dns/
│ ├── main.tf
├── security/
│ ├── main.tf
├── ecs/
│ ├── main.tf
├── cicd/
│ ├── main.tf
├── observability/
│ ├── main.tf
├── application_logging/
│ ├── main.tf


## Infrastructure Components

### Networking

- **VPC and Subnets:** Configures a VPC with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones for high availability.
- **Internet Gateway and Route Tables:** Provides internet access for public subnets.

### Security

- **Security Groups:** Defines inbound and outbound traffic rules for ECS services and applications.

### DNS

- **Route 53:** Manages DNS records for your domain.

### ECS

- **ECS Cluster and Services:** Deploys containerized applications using AWS ECS with Fargate.
- **Application Load Balancer:** Balances incoming application traffic across ECS tasks.

### CI/CD

- **CodePipeline:** Automates the build, test, and deployment process.
- **CodeBuild:** Compiles and builds application code into Docker images.
- **CodeDeploy:** Deploys updated applications to ECS.
- **CodeCommit:** Acts as the source code repository.

### Observability

- **CloudWatch Logs and Metrics:** Captures logs and custom metrics for ECS services.
- **CloudWatch Alarms:** Triggers alerts based on application performance and health.
- **SNS Notifications:** Sends alerts to specified endpoints (e.g., email).

### Application Monitoring and Logging

- **CloudWatch Logs for Applications:** Captures and stores application logs.
- **Custom CloudWatch Metrics:** Monitors specific application performance indicators.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the infrastructure, ensure you have the following:

- **AWS Account:** Access to an AWS account with permissions to create resources.
- **Terraform:** Install Terraform on your local machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- **AWS CLI:** Install and configure the AWS CLI with your credentials.

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo/terraform

2. Configure Variables
Edit main.tf and module variable files to customize the variables according to your environment, including AWS region, domain name, and email for alerts.

3. Initialize Terraform
Initialize the Terraform configuration:

terraform init

4. Plan the Deployment
Run the Terraform plan to see what changes will be made:
terraform plan

5. Apply the Configuration
Apply the Terraform configuration to deploy the infrastructure:

terraform apply


6. Verify Deployment
ECS Console: Check the ECS console to verify that the cluster and services are running.
CloudWatch Console: Monitor logs, metrics, and alarms in the CloudWatch console.
Route 53: Verify DNS records and access the application via the DNS name of the load balancer.

Application Development and Deployment

Commit Changes to CodeCommit:
Push your application code, including the buildspec.yml and appspec.yaml files, to the CodeCommit repository.
Pipeline Execution:
The CodePipeline will automatically trigger upon code changes, executing the build and deployment process.
Monitoring and Alerts

Logs: Check application logs in the CloudWatch Logs console.
Metrics and Alarms: Monitor custom metrics and receive alerts via email when thresholds are breached.
Customization

Buildspec and AppSpec: Customize the buildspec.yml and appspec.yaml to fit your application's build and deployment needs.
Thresholds and Patterns: Adjust thresholds and patterns in the observability and logging modules to match your requirements.


Cleanup

To destroy the resources created by this Terraform configuration, run:
terraform destroy

Confirm the destruction by typing yes when prompted.

### Instructions

1. **Create the directory structure:** Organize your project files as shown in the project structure section.
2. **Copy the Terraform scripts:** Use the Terraform scripts provided earlier to populate each module's `main.tf` file in the appropriate directory.
3. **Modify configurations:** Update the placeholders (like `<YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID>`, `example.com`, etc.) with your specific configurations.
4. **Follow deployment instructions:** Use the command-line instructions in the README to deploy and manage your infrastructure.
